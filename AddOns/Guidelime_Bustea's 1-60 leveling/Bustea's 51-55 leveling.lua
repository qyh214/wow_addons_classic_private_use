Inside the Slag Pit go across the bridge, on your left will be the Quarry Gate, go through it. Work your way northwards until a bigger room where you’ll find Enslaved Archeologists and a big 52 Elite elite golem lying down (ignore it). Go up the iron slope, midway on the slope you have 2 options, straight or left. Go straight. You’ll soon enter a room with several pairs of taskmasters and slavers.
In this room further in and to the right you’ll find Overseer Maltorius and 2 Dark Iron Sentries for [QC7701]. These are 3 elites so you can’t solo them. You can either try to find more people (I managed to duo it with mage + paladin) or just abandon this quest. What I usually do is grind in the Slag Pit while looking for people to kill Overseer Maltorius. However, behind these 3 elites you can find Secret Plans: Fiery Flux for [QC7722].
From the same big room, go over the iron bridge which is on the opposite side of the 3 elites. On the other side of the bridge, jump down to the lower floor. From this spot go east and you should find Incendosaurs, kill 20 of them for [QC7727]
When done with that, go back up the ramp and then get out of the Slag Pit, jump down back into the Cauldron and work your way westwards.

If it doesn’t work try different spots in this room until you get a Hive Wall Sample for [QC3883]. At this point you might already have gotten a Gorishi Scent Gland. If you didn’t, keep on killing these bugs until one drops for [QC4496]. It can drop from any of the bugs, inside or outside the lair, it doesn’t matter.
Go directly south of the bug lair and up the mountain [G50,88 Un'Goro Crater]. You should find 2 Pterrordax there, kill them. A bit further to the west you should find another of those spots up the mountains with 4 or 5 Pterrordax there [G44,87 Un'Goro Crater], kill them. Stay at this spot until you get your 10 Pterrordax kills for [QC4501], you can kill some bugs while waiting on respawns.
Ride to the Expedition Camp at [G38,66 Un'Goro Crater], try to avoid the aggros as much as possible because most mobs are too tough for you here. At the Expedition Camp, look for a pile of crates named “Research Equipment” and loot them for [QC3881,2]. Then go northwest, run away from any aggro if you have to, the lake is pretty safe so I suggest you just swim through it.
Go northwest until you reach the big rock on the other side of the lake. Behind this rock you'll find a little goblin named Krakle, get his quest quickly [QA974]. (Quickly because a Devilsaur roams at this place every now and then.)

Once inside the Ruins of Eldarath, look for the tablets for [QC3517]. They spawn at random locations, so all you have to do is search through the entire ruins while killing everything. See this as a little grinding session.
