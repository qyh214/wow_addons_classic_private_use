[NX58-60 Bustea's Horde Guide PHASE 1-4]
[GA Horde]

You should be level [XP55 55] to start this guide.
Down the slope in Un'Goro talk to Torwa Pathfinder [G71,76 Un'Goro Crater]
Accept [QA4301][QA4292]
Ride north until the eastern crystal pylon, go up the trail and further east and you should see some huge dinosaur skeletons at [G80,49 Un'Goro Crater]. Be full health/mana and ready to face a level 56 mob. Open Torwa’s pouch in your inventory, loot the Preserved Threshadon Meat and the Pheromone Mixture, right click the meat, and then right click the Pheromone, Lar’korwi will appear, kill him and loot his head for [QC4292]
Ride north/northwest to Fungal Rock [G63,16 Un'Goro Crater]. Enter the cave, at the fork take the narrow path in the middle, then go right and keep going until you hit the end of the cave. Just be very careful where you fight the Un'Goro Gorilla, they call for help. At the end of the cave in a room with a puddle of water and a rock in the middle you’ll find U’cha, lvl 55 Gorilla. There’s another gorilla in the same room but you can pull it solo if you wait for U’cha to go away. Then pull U’cha solo, kill it and loot his pelt for [QC4301]
Clear out the cave for the upcoming Escort, then accept [QA4244] and turn [QT4244 it] back in.
Accept [QA4245] and do the escort.
Turn in [QT4245]
Accept [QA4492]
Go southwest until you hit the river [G40,27 Un'Goro Crater]. On the southern side of the river you’ll find plenty of Dinos and some Oozes.
*In this area, kill every Frenzied Pterrordax, Elder Diametradon and Ooze you find.*
Kill them until youre done with [QC4503][QC3882][QC4501]
You should also have about *30x Un'Goro Slime Samples* by now.
go southeast to Fire Plume Ridge, climb the mountain from the southern side in the middle [G49,53 Un'Goro Crater]. Find your way to the top of Fire plume ridge, you’ll have to do almost a full circle around it for that, ignore the cave with Ringo for now. Kill every fire elemental on your way and you should get the 9 Un'Goro Ash you need for [QC4502]
When at the top of Fire Plume Ridge, next to the lava pool you should see a conic stone named “Fire Plume Ridge Hot Spot”. Search your inventory for Krakle’s Thermometer, right click it next to the conic stone, this should complete [QC974]. Don’t get too close to the cave at the top, there’s a lvl 56 Elite elemental there, avoid it.
If you got 9 Un'Goro Ash already no need to kill more elementals, just get off fire plume ridge from the west side and ride west until Golakka hot springs and find Krakle behind the geyser hill [G30,50 Un'Goro Crater]. Turn in [QT974] and accept [QA980]
Turn in [QT4301][QT4292]
Go northwest to Fire Plume Ridge (yes, again!). Climb on it from the southern side in the middle [G49,53 Un'Goro Crater] then go a bit east to reach the cave where Ringo is [G52,51 Un'Goro Crater]. Turn in [QT4492] and accept [QA4491]. Search your inventory for Spraggle’s Canteen and put it on a hotkey. Everytime Ringo faints, click the canteen while being next to him. Get off the mountain by the eastern side, then go north, run to Marshall’s Refuge while making sure Ringo always follows you, try to avoid mobs as much as possible. Run inside Marshall’s Refuge until Spraggle Frock for [QC4491].
Turn in [QT4501][QT4491][QT3882][QT4503]
Destroy the Canteen
Hearth to [H Orgrimmar]
Put the Slime samples in your bank.

Fly to [F Everlook]
Turn in [QT3909] and accept [QA3912]
Fly to [F Ratchet]
Turn in [QT4502]
Fly to [F Gadgetzan]
Go to the Graveyard [G53,28 Tanaris]
Drink the Videre Elixir, you’ll die, but don’t worry, no durability loss from this, it’s normal. Release spirit but don’t resurrect, go directly north from the Graveyard and up the mountain, you should soon see the yellow dot on your minimap, go to it and talk to Gaeriyan, turn in [QT3912] and accept [QA3913]
Go back to the graveyard, resurrect and click the gravestone named “A Conspicuous Gravestone”, turn in [QT3913] and accept [QA3914]. You can destroy the other Videre Elixirs.

Turn in [QT5156][QT3942] and accept [QA4084]
Turn in [QT4102]
*Talk to her and ask her for a Cenarion Beacon. From now on when you kill stuff in Felwood you can get Corrupted Soul Shards, which you will turn in later for Cenarion Plant Salves. With those salves you can cure corrupted plants in felwood and get consumables and buffs in return.*
Get back on the road, ride to Jaedenar [G40,57 Felwood]
*Now you need atleast one more person to do some quests with.*
Enter the Shadow Hold [G35,58 Felwood]
*Dousing the Flames of Protection is doable solo (but kinda hard), on the other hand there’s an escort quest which is very hard to solo, if not impossible depending on your class and equipment. It also depends on how crowded the area is, if there’s lots of people killing stuff in the shadow hold already, it’s doable solo. Anyway, give it a try solo, but grouping for this one is just easier.*
Clear the way down the first tunnel, in the first room you’ll find a captured elf named Arko’narin. This is the NPC that gives the escort quest, but to get it you first need to find a *Blood Red Key* from one of the mobs inside Shadow Hold, click it and accept [QA5202] You have to turn this quest at Captured Arko’narin later. The follow up will be the escort quest.
In the same room you can find the 1st and 2nd brazier (the 2nd one is on the slope going to the next tunnel), click them to turn them off.
If you are in a group, and get a Blood Red Key (the whole group can loot it if it drops), tell everyone to turn in the first quest at the captured elf. When everyone has turned in the first quest [QT5202], one person should start [QA5203], which is the escort quest. Note: You have to click on the elf through the cage. Some people try to click the cage itself, but that doesn’t work.
*Escort Arko’Narin to her equipment, then escort her out, things can get rough at times because she engages 2 or 3 lvl 55 mobs a the same time and is fragile until she has her equipment on. In the same room where her equipment is you’ll find the 3rd and 4th Brazier, turn them off too. At the exit a 53 Elite mob will attack you.*
Defeat the Elite for [QC5203]
Turn in [QT4521] and accept [QA4741]
Get back on the road and ride north until Irontree Woods. Go to the crater at [G49,27 Felwood], you’ll find plenty of Toxic Horrors there, kill them until you got 3 Toxic Horror Droplet for [QC5086]. There’s more Toxic Horrors all around the big green pool just north of the crater.
In the same area, kill Itontree Stompers until one of them drops an Irontree Heart for [QC4084,2]
Go up the plateau east of Irontree Woods, where you will find plenty of bears and wolves. Kill them until you have 11 Silver Claws for [QC4084,1]
Turn in [QT980] and accept [QA4842]
Turn in [QT5086] and accept [QA5087]
*Should you find the Winterfall Runners on your way, make sure to kill them and loot the Winterfall Crate. However don’t actually go out of your way to look for them, just kill them if you encounter them while following the next paragraphs*
Accept [QA977]
Kill Winterfall Shamans, Den Watchers and Ursas for [QC8464] at [G64,36 Winterspring]
Go south of Winterfall Village, to Ice Thistle Hills, this time enter the cave further to the east up the hills [G68,42 Winterspring] and kill Ice Thistle Matriarchs/Patriarchs until you get 2 Pristine Yeti Horn for [QC977]
Go back to Everlook, turn in [QT977] and accept [QA5163]. Find a goblin named Legacki, she stands to the left of the Inn. Target her and right click Umi’s Mechanical Yeti from your inventory for [QC5163,1].
Get out of Everlook, follow the road southeast / south until you find Owl Wing Ticket [G63,59 Winterspring], the entrance of it is marked by two broken pillars and an elf named Ranshalla standing in front of it. Go inside Owl Wing Ticket and kill 13 Moontouched Owlbeasts for [QC4741]
Get back on the road and ride south, go over the ice bridge and keep going south until you discover Darkwhisper Gorge and get the complete message for [QC4842]
Hearth to [H Orgrimmar]
Fly to [F Splintertree Post]
Ride north into Felwood
Turn in [QT5165] and accept [QA5242]
Turn in [QT5203] and accept [QA5204]
Turn in [QT4084] and accept [QA4005]
Ride north and go to Jaedenar, clear the way and enter the Shadow Hold. Clear inside the hold further than where you went last time past the last two braziers, past the red pool with the Oozes. Just a bit further down a slope you should find a room with an altar in its middle, 4 warlocks/darkweavers around it, performing a ritual, and Rakaiah in front.
You can pull Rakaiah solo, the 4 warlocks will be aggro on you but won’t attack as long as you don’t get too close to them. After you got rid of Rakaiah for [QC5204], you will still be locked in combat mode because of the 4 warlocks, to lose combat mode you just have to run back some distance away from them until they forget you. Basically they never attack you unless you get close. However the warlock’s imp pets will attack you and you should dispose of them.
Kill the 2 other mobs on each side of the room and the one in the back, then you can kill each of the 4 warlocks one by one. When the room is clear, click on the Remains of Trey Lightforge on the altar and turn in [QT5204] then accept [QA5385]
Go past the Altar Room and down a spiral, after a couple of pulls you’ll be facing a small bridge going up straight ahead and a slope going down to your left.
Go left and keep going in that direction until you reach a big room where you’ll find Shadow Lord Fel’dan and his two succubus guards.
It wasn’t an easy fight to solo, I basically used everything I had with the mage and rogue. I sheeped Shadow Lord Fel’dan and killed the two succubus fast. Same with rogue, I sapped the shadow lord and killed it last. With the warrior I used retaliation. Don’t forget to loot the head of the Shadow Lord for [QC5242]
This part of the dungeon is just much easier with a group, you can try it solo but I recommend at least finding a person to duo it with.
Turn in [QT5385][QT5242]
Turn in [QT4741] and accept [QA4721]
Fly to [F Everlook]
Get on your mount and ride southeast/south along the road until Owl Wing Ticket. Kill Owlbeasts until you have 10 Berserk Owlbeast kills for [QC4721] and have found a *Blue-feathered Necklace* off one of the owlbeasts. When you get the Blue-feathered necklace right-click it and acdept [QA4882]
Ride back towards Everlook. Now we’re gonna hunt for the Winterfall Runners, check the map below to see their route. I advise you start from Winterfall Village and follow the route westwards, to the Timbermaw Hold tunnel, until you find the Winterfall Runners.
When you find the 3 Winterfall Runners (lvl 57), you don’t have to kill all 3. Just kill one fast and run away, come back and loot the crate for [QC5087]. They all drop it.

Open *Eridan's Supplies* in your inventory and loot it all. Step inside the circle and click the Book, Aquementas will spawn. Stand in the circle and let him hit you once. THis should give you the totem for [QC4005]
Delete the other 3 items.

Turn in [QT4005] and accept [QA3961]

Then do the same thing with the red pot, until you have 5 Corrupted Felwood Samples for [QC4293]. You can then destroy the remaining samples you have.

Stay in the ruins and kill golems until you have 10 Fractured Elemental Shards for [QC4061].

Go to the area which is north of Dreadmaul Rock [G78,28 Burning Steppes], you should find Black Broodlings there. Search your inventory for Draco-Incarcinatrix 900 and put it on a hotkey. Use it on every Black Broodling before killing them. When they die while having the incarcinatrix aura on, a crystal will appear at their corpse named “Broodling Essence”.

Turn in [QT6029], at the same npc pick the other quest and turn it in instantly to get your Argent Dawn Commission. When you kill undeads while having this trinket equipped, you can collect Scourgestones from their bodies. I suggest equipping it from now on everytime you kill undeads in eastern and western plaguelands.
*Turning in these Scourgestones at Argent Officer Pureheart gets you faction increases with the Argent Dawn and a token. These tokens are the only way to raise your faction with the Argent Dawn at a certain point in revered, so save them until then.*

Get out of Dalson’s Tears and go southwest to the Ruins of Andorhal. In Andorhal try to avoid the roads as much as possible, as level 56 elite abominations roam them. So just clear yourself a path through the destroyed houses. Also avoid the center of the town of course, there’s a huge bunch of mobs there and Araj the Summoner (lvl 61 elite).
Clear yourself a path to the first tower you see on your right-hand side [G42,66 Western Plaguelands], but be careful not to aggro the Skeletal Warlord inside of it (lvl 56-57 elite). You can drop the torch at the entrance of the watchtower without aggroing the Skeletal Warlord if you just get close to it without being in it’s line of sight.
