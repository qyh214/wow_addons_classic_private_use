Turn in [QT5153] and accept [QA5154]
Accept [QA4971]
Go to the northern gate of Andorhal, and east of the first watch tower you'll find two wooden silos [G45,62 Western Plaguelands]
Get full hp/mana, get next to one of them and click your Temporal Displacer (looks like a horn). 1 to 3 lvl 57 worms will spawn and attack you. When it's 3 it might be tough to handle solo, so always start those fights with full hp and if possible potions / long cooldown abilities up. Back off from the silos after you summon the worms, if you stay too close more worms will spawn sometimes, and that's probably more than you can handle solo.
The worms only appear when the silo is sparkling blue. They take a while to sparkle again after you use the temporal displacer next to them. There's 3 more silos just a bit more to the east.
Keep doing that until you have 15 Temporal Parasites slain for [QC4971]
Turn in [QT4971] and accept [QA4973]
Now what you have to do is to check every destroyed houses in Andorhal and look for *Small Lockboxes* and loot the Watches from them for [QC4973]
Go to the town hall (with a tower clock) which is in the middle of Andorhal, close to where *Araj the Summoner* is, you can sneak in the town hall without having to fight any of the bunch of mobs close to it.
Inside the town hall you'll find several *Musty Tome* lying on the floor. When you click one, there is a chance you will find the Annals of Darrowshire, but there is a higher chance that you will get a *Ruined Tome* and 1 or 2 level 57 mobs will attack you. They give no loot and no EXP. However there is a trick to know which Tome is the right one. There is a slight graphical difference. The pages of the fake tomes have two-tone colored pages, light-brown and white.
You can easily see the difference if you zoom in 1st person view and put your mouse pointer over the books to highlight them. Loot the Annals of Darrowshire for [QC5154]
Turn in [QT4973]
*The Attuned Dampener you get as a reward is only usable on Araj the Summoner, so save it for later when you are 60 and do the big quests. Killing Araj is necessary to get your Scholomance key and another quest for a decent trinket. You'll need a solid group of 60s to kill him, but the Attuned Dampener will help.*
Turn in [QT5154] and accept [QA5210]
Now you should also have finished [QC964], if you haven't, kill some more skeletons while you are in Andorhal.
Turn in [QT5542][QT5543][QT5544]
Accept [QA5742] listen to him and then turn [QT5742 it] back in.
Accept [QA5781]
Go southeast to the Undercroft, which is directly south of the Marris Stead.
Behind the crypt in the Undercroft you'll find Tiron Fordring's Grave [G28,86 Eastern Plaguelands]. Next to should be a "Loose Dirt Mound". This is where you need help, this almost impossible to do solo unless you use a lot of creativity and everything you got. Anyway here is what happens when you click the dirt mount, Mercutio Filthgorger and 3 Dwarf Graverobbers spawn and go to the dirt mound, if you are close they of course jump you.
They all hit hard, especially Mercutio, and all have a lot of hit points for non elites. Here is what I suggest:
*As soon as you click the dirt mount, run to the other side of the fence, you can jump over it if you walk up the mountain a bit. The 4 dwarves will walk to the grave and stand there.*
*Ignore the 3 adds and go all out on Mercurio, loot the hammer for [QC5781] and run.*
Go inside the crypt [G27,85 Eastern Plaguelands], clear the way down, kill Zaeldarr the Outcast and loot his head for [QC6021]
In the same room look for a "Torn Scroll" on the floor, click it can get [QA6024]
Turn in [QT5781] and accept [QA5845]

Loot it for [QC5181,2]
Go north to Blackwood Lake [G49,51 Eastern Plaguelands]. Take a dive, in the middle of the pool at the bottom you'll see Ghosts of Darrowshire fighting each other, amongst them you should see a glowing violet skull named *Horgus Skull* [G51,50 Eastern Plaguelands]
Loot it for [QC5181,1]
Go west to the Plaguewoods. In the Plaguewoods look around for Large Termite Mounds and loot them for [QC5901]
Kill stuff inside Plaguewood while looking for those termite mounds, but also try to find as much *Cannibal Ghouls* as possible. Anytime you kill one of these, a Spirit of Darrowshire will appear, right click it to free it. You need to free *15 Darrowshire Spirits* for [QC5211]. The Cannibal Ghouls are not so numerous though, so it will take a while, consider this as a mini grinding session, plus you are getting faction with the Argent Dawn and Scourgestones.
Go east to the Quel'Lithien Lodge [G51,22 Eastern Plaguelands]. Clear yourself a path to the main building, and clear towards the right-hand wing. You should find two level 60 Quel'Lithien Protectors, kill them and then loot the Quel'lithien Registry for [Q6133], which should be lying on a bench.

Go east to Zul'Mashar [G64,24 Eastern Plaguelands]. Clear the way up the slope, and to the east, you'll soon face a big pyramid. At it's base you should see tombs with some trolls roaming about them. One of them is *Infiltrator Hameya*. Clear some of the trolls until you get a clear pull on Hameya, pull him solo and kill him, then loot his key for [QC6024]
Clear your way out of Zul'Mashar then go southeast to Northdale, take a dive in the pool which is just south of Northdale. Clear the elementals in the way. At [G71,33 Eastern Plaguelands], next to a cage you should see a white flag with a blue runed on it named *Symbol of Lost Honor*
Loot it for [QC5845]
Turn in [QT5181][QT5211] at [G81,59 Eastern Plaguelands]
