WIM (WoW Instant Messenger) is a World of Warcraft addon which brings an instant messenger feel to communication in game.

I created WIM over 2 years ago with the curiosity of creating an addon. Since then, WIM has evolved into what it is today, however so many requests from the community were added into the addon which resulted in bulky and inefficient coding practices that took a toll on both CPU and Memory usage. To resolve this, I decided to rewrite WIM from scratch. Each feature is being reintroduced one at a time and being advanced upon. That being said, I welcome you to WIM 3.0.
