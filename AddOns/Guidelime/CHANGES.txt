    do not consider quest positions when there are over 1000
    
    this was causing severe lag when using the editor
    eg with quests like "Caught!" (4449) which has silk cloth as an objective

    corrections to quests db
    
    - requires any prequest for druid "Moonglade" (5922) and "Lessons Anew" (6126)
    - source npc was switched for druid bear form quests "Heeding the Call" (5926 / 5928)
