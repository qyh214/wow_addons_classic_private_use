# Deadly Boss Mods Core

## [1.13.22](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/tree/1.13.22) (2019-11-29)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/compare/1.13.21...1.13.22)

- Just pushing new release version to get lua error fix out for majordomo. There really was nothing much to add to classic dbm for last week, I just made everyone wait 7 days for a single bug fix so they wouldn't complain mod was updated too fast/often.  
- Fixed lua error with Majordomo, closes #26
